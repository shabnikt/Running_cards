 Simple Tkinter game

I made the game in 2021. I saw a little video of the guys playing a fun card game at a party. I didn't know the rules, but I figured it out based on the video.

You need to press Enter, and depending on the suit of the kata that you "pull" from the deck, the ace of this suit moves forward. Well the path also lies a few maps. When all 4 aces pass them, they turn over and indicate with their suit which ace should step back. The suit that comes first wins.
